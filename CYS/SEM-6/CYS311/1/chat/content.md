### **Introduction to Computer Forensics**  

Computer forensics plays a vital role in the investigation and prosecution of cybercriminals.  
The process includes acquisition, inspection, and reporting of information stored across  
computers and networks related to a civil or criminal incident.  

Forensic investigators are trained professionals who can extract, analyze, report, and  
investigate cases that involve technology as the source or the victim of a crime.  

This module introduces computer forensics in today’s world. It discusses some of the most  
important problems and concerns that forensic investigators face today. The main objective  
of this module is to familiarize you with these topics.
