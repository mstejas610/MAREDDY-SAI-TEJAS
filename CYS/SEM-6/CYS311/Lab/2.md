### **Cyber Forensics Lab 02**  

#### **Task 1: Recovering Deleted Files from Hard Disks Using WinHex**  
- **Objective:** Use WinHex, a forensic hex editor, to recover deleted files from a raw disk image.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Setup:** Created a disk image (dd format) of a pen drive using the `dd` command.  
  2. **Tool Installation:** Downloaded and installed WinHex from the official site.  
  3. **Opening the Image:** Loaded the `.dd` disk image into WinHex.  
  4. **File Recovery:**  
     - Scanned the image to locate deleted files.  
     - Selected and recovered images that were deleted.  
  5. **Outcome:** Successfully restored deleted files from the disk image using WinHex’s recovery features.  

#### **Task 2: Analyzing File System Types Using The Sleuth Kit**  
- **Objective:** Use The Sleuth Kit (TSK) command-line tools to analyze different file system structures.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Installation:** Downloaded and extracted The Sleuth Kit (TSK) from the official website.  
  2. **File System Analysis:**  
     - **fsstat:** Extracted file system metadata (e.g., type, block size, and journal details).  
     - **istat:** Attempted to analyze inode metadata structures but didn’t get an expected output.  
     - **fls:** Listed all files and directories, including deleted ones, within a disk image.  
     - **img_stat:** Provided detailed information about the disk image, such as sector size and partition layout.  
  3. **Outcome:** Demonstrated how The Sleuth Kit helps in forensic investigations by extracting file system data.  

#### **Task 3: Analyzing Raw Images Using Autopsy**  
- **Objective:** Use Autopsy, a graphical front-end for The Sleuth Kit, to analyze a disk image.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Setting Up a Case:** Created a new case in Autopsy.  
  2. **Adding Evidence:** Imported a disk image for analysis.  
  3. **File Analysis:**  
     - Displayed all files, including deleted ones.  
     - Generated an MD5 hash list for integrity verification.  
  4. **Image Details:**  
     - Viewed file system metadata, content information, and forensic details of the disk image.  
  5. **Outcome:** Provided an easy-to-use graphical interface for forensic analysis, making investigation more efficient.
