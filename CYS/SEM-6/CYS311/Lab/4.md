### **Cyber Forensics Lab 04 â€“ Password Cracking & Steganography Detection**  

This lab focuses on two primary aspects of cyber forensics:  
1. **Cracking Application Passwords** â€“ Recovering lost or forgotten passwords from various file formats.  
2. **Detecting Steganography** â€“ Extracting hidden messages from images and audio files.

## **Task 1: Cracking Application Passwords**  

### **1. Installing Passware Kit**  
- **Passware Kit** is a comprehensive password recovery tool that supports various file formats, including Office documents, ZIP archives, and even system login passwords.  
- It uses multiple attack methods, such as brute force, dictionary attacks, and decryption techniques, to recover lost passwords.  

#### **Steps to Crack a Password-Protected Document**  
1. Open Passware Kit and select the type of file you need to unlock (e.g., Word, Excel, or PDF).  
2. Choose the password recovery method:
   - **Brute Force** (tries all possible combinations).  
   - **Dictionary Attack** (uses a predefined list of common passwords).  
   - **Smart Attack** (analyzes password patterns and optimizes the cracking process).  
3. Start the recovery process, which may take time depending on password complexity.  
4. Once found, use the recovered password to access the document.

### **2. Installing Advanced Archive Password Recovery**  
- This tool specializes in unlocking compressed archive files like **ZIP, RAR, ACE, and ARJ**.  
- It supports different encryption methods, including **AES-256-bit encryption**, making it a powerful tool for forensic investigators.  

#### **Steps to Crack an Archive Password**  
1. Open the Advanced Archive Password Recovery tool.  
2. Load the password-protected archive file.  
3. Select an attack type:
   - **Dictionary Attack** (uses a predefined wordlist).  
   - **Brute Force Attack** (tries all possible combinations).  
   - **Mask Attack** (if some characters are known, e.g., length or starting letter).  
4. Start the recovery process, and once the password is cracked, extract the archive contents.

### **3. Installing Advanced PDF Password Recovery**  
- This tool helps recover lost or forgotten passwords for encrypted **PDF files** and can remove editing restrictions.  

#### **Steps to Recover a PDF Password**  
1. Open the **Advanced PDF Password Recovery** tool.  
2. Load the password-protected PDF file.  
3. Choose a recovery method:
   - **Instant Unlock** (for weak encryption).  
   - **Dictionary or Brute Force Attack** (for stronger encryption).  
4. The tool attempts to crack the password and displays it once recovered.  

This process is crucial for forensic investigations involving locked PDF files, legal documents, or secured reports.

## **Task 2: Detecting Steganography**  

Steganography is the practice of **hiding information inside images, audio files, or other media** to conceal data from unauthorized access. This task focuses on detecting and extracting hidden data.  

### **1. Installing StegSpy**  
- **StegSpy** is a tool used to detect hidden messages in images by analyzing anomalies in the image structure.  
- It helps forensic analysts identify images that may contain steganographic data.  

#### **Running StegSpy**  
1. Open **StegSpy** and load the suspect image file.  
2. The tool scans the image for hidden data using steganalysis techniques.  
3. If detected, StegSpy will alert the user that the image contains hidden content.

### **2. Image Steganography Detection**  

#### **Decoding Hidden Messages in Images**  
- Some tools allow users to extract hidden data from images.  
- The **Image Steganography Tool** is used to decode and extract hidden messages from stego-images.  

#### **Steps to Extract Hidden Data**  
1. Open the **Image Steganography Tool**.  
2. Load the suspect image file.  
3. Run the extraction process to recover hidden data.  
4. The tool reveals hidden messages, if any are embedded in the image pixels.  

---

### **3. Installing OpenStego**  
- **OpenStego** is a steganography tool used for both hiding and extracting data from images.  

#### **Extracting Data Using OpenStego**  
1. Open **OpenStego** and select the "Extract Data" option.  
2. Load the stego-image (an image suspected of containing hidden data).  
3. The tool extracts any embedded messages and saves them as a separate file.  

---

### **4. Installing DeepSound**  
- **DeepSound** is used for **audio steganography**, where hidden data is embedded inside sound files.  
- It supports **WAV, FLAC, and MP3** formats.  

#### **Steps to Extract Data from an Audio File**  
1. Open **DeepSound** and load the suspect audio file.  
2. Click the **"Extract Hidden Data"** option.  
3. The tool scans the audio file and extracts any concealed information.
