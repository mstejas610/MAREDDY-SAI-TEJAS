### **Cyber Forensics Lab 03**  

#### **Task 1: Investigating an NTFS Drive Using Disk Explorer for NTFS**  
- **Objective:** Use Disk Explorer to analyze the NTFS file system structure and inspect raw disk data.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Tool Installation:** Downloaded Disk Explorer for NTFS from the official website.  
  2. **Loading a Disk Image:**  
     - Downloaded a sample NTFS disk image from the NIST File Carving Repository.  
     - Opened the image file in Disk Explorer.  
  3. **Sector Analysis:**  
     - Moved to specific disk sectors to examine raw data.  
     - Viewed the sector contents in hexadecimal format.  
  4. **Copying Data:**  
     - Extracted data from specific sectors to a new image file for further analysis.  
  5. **Outcome:** Successfully explored the NTFS structure at a sector level, demonstrating how forensic investigators can analyze disk images for evidence.  

#### **Task 2: Viewing Contents of a Forensic Image Using FTK Imager**  
- **Objective:** Use FTK Imager to inspect and analyze forensic disk images.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Installation:** Downloaded FTK Imager from Exterro’s website.  
  2. **Opening an Evidence File:**  
     - Loaded a forensic image into FTK Imager.  
     - Viewed partition structures, file listings, and metadata.  
  3. **Forensic Analysis:**  
     - Examined deleted files, hidden data, and metadata.  
     - Verified file integrity using hash values.  
  4. **Outcome:** FTK Imager provided an in-depth, forensic-friendly view of disk images, helping in digital investigations.  

#### **Task 3: Working with Raw Image (IMG) Dump Files – Mounting and Resizing Partitions**  
- **Objective:** Create, mount, and modify raw disk image files.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Creating an IMG File:** Used forensic tools to create a raw disk image (IMG format).  
  2. **Mounting the Image:**  
     - Attached the image to a virtual environment for analysis.  
     - Allowed access to files and directories as if it were a real disk.  
  3. **Unmounting:**  
     - Properly unmounted the disk image after analysis.  
  4. **Outcome:** Demonstrated how to work with raw forensic images by mounting and examining their contents.  

### **Final Summary of All Labs:**  
Across the three labs, different cyber forensic tools were used to:  
✅ Recover deleted data (EaseUS, WinHex)  
✅ Generate and verify hash values (HashCalc, MD5 Calculator)  
✅ Analyze file system structures (The Sleuth Kit, Disk Explorer)  
✅ Investigate forensic images (FTK Imager, Autopsy, P2 Commander)  
✅ Create and handle disk images (R-Drive Image, IMG Mounting)  

These labs covered essential forensic techniques used in digital investigations. Let me know if you need further explanations!
