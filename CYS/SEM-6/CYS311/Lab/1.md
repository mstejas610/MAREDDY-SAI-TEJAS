Alright, let’s dive into each lab step-by-step!  

### **Cyber Forensics Lab 01**  

#### **Task 1: Recovering Data using the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard**  
- **Objective:** Test the effectiveness of the EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard in retrieving deleted files.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Setup:** Created and deleted files on the D drive using the Shift+Delete method to permanently delete them.  
  2. **Tool Download & Installation:** Downloaded the tool from the official EaseUS website.  
  3. **Scanning:** Launched the EaseUS tool and initiated a scan on the D drive.  
  4. **Recovery:** Selected the deleted files detected by the tool and chose the Desktop as the recovery destination. Importantly, the recovery location was different from the original location to avoid overwriting any recoverable data.  
  5. **Result:** Successfully recovered the deleted files, demonstrating the tool's effectiveness.  

#### **Task 2: Performing Hash, Checksum, or HMAC Calculations Using HashCalc**  
- **Objective:** Use HashCalc to calculate various cryptographic hashes and HMAC values.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Installation:** Downloaded HashCalc from the official SalvaSoft website.  
  2. **Hash Calculation:**  
     - Inputted different text strings and files into the tool.  
     - Generated hash values such as MD5, SHA-1, and CRC32.  
  3. **HMAC Calculation:**  
     - Used a password to generate HMAC values for authentication and integrity verification.  
  4. **Outcome:** Demonstrated how to use HashCalc for both hash and HMAC calculations to verify data integrity and authenticity.  

#### **Task 3: Generating MD5 Hashes Using MD5 Calculator**  
- **Objective:** Generate and verify MD5 hashes of files.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Download & Installation:** Retrieved the MD5 Calculator from Bullzip’s website.  
  2. **Usage:**  
     - Right-clicked on a file and selected “MD5 Calculator” from the context menu.  
     - Generated the MD5 hash and noted it down.  
  3. **Verification:**  
     - Used the generated hash to verify the file’s integrity over time or after transfer.  
  4. **Result:** Validated that MD5 hashes can ensure data consistency and detect file tampering.  

#### **Task 4: Viewing Files of Various Formats Using the File Viewer**  
- **Objective:** Open and inspect different file formats.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Installation:** Downloaded File Viewer from AccessoryWare's website.  
  2. **File Inspection:**  
     - Loaded various files (e.g., text, images, PDFs) into the viewer.  
     - Analyzed the content without altering the original files.  
  3. **Outcome:** Enabled viewing of multiple file formats for forensic examination without changing metadata.  

#### **Task 5: Handling Evidence Data Using P2 Commander**  
- **Objective:** Manage and analyze forensic evidence data.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Installation:** Installed P2 Commander from Paraben’s website.  
  2. **Evidence Handling:**  
     - Imported raw disk images and other forensic data.  
     - Examined file structures, metadata, and logs.  
  3. **Reporting:**  
     - Generated comprehensive forensic reports summarizing findings.  
  4. **Outcome:** Showed how P2 Commander aids in professional forensic investigations and report generation.  

#### **Task 6: Creating a Disk Image File of a Hard Disk Partition Using R-Drive Image**  
- **Objective:** Create a disk image for data preservation and analysis.  
- **Process:**  
  1. **Download & Installation:** Installed R-Drive Image from the official site.  
  2. **Disk Imaging:**  
     - Selected a specific partition and created a complete disk image file.  
     - Saved the image file for future forensic analysis.  
  3. **Result:** Successfully created a reliable disk image, preserving data integrity for investigations.
