A sketch conveys the measurement relationship between the crime scene and the evidence
found. The sketch explains the data in the documented photos and videos. Sketches can also
portray the positions of the camera as well as the photographer.

The points to remember while sketching the scene are:

» After securing the scene, the computer forensic professional (CFP) has to prepare a
sketch of the crime scene.

» This sketch should include all details about the objects present and their locations
within the office area.

» As with photographs, forensic professionals prepare many sketches of the complete
scene, all the way down to the smallest piece of evidence.

» After creating an accurate scene sketch, the CFP should sketch the top of the computer
desk, specifying pieces of evidence.

Computer crime scene investigation requires significant effort. The investigation effort varies
according to the situation, and without a checklist, it is impossible to remember all the findings
of the computer crime investigation. The investigator uses the checklist to note down the
findings of the digital evidence search, collection, and preservation processes at the crime
scene.

The investigators should have keen knowledge of all the devices that could have played part in
transmitting the attack data to the victim device. They should be able to search for all the
involved devices and seize them in a formal manner in order to analyze them for evidential

Consent, in computer forensics investigation, refers to the process of obtaining formal
permission from the owner of the victim organization or an individual owning the target system
to perform a thorough investigation. A written consent from the authority is enough to start
the investigation and search process.

At the time of consent, the investigators should use properly written banners with suitable use
policies and get them signed from the owner of the evidence scene or devices. If you have a
properly worded banner and a suitable use policy informing users of monitoring activities and
how to use the information collected from monitoring activities, the consent burden will suffice
in a majority of cases.

There are instances when the user is present and has to provide consent as the hardware user.
It should never be a general permission for system administrators to conduct unplanned and
random monitoring activities.

Use appropriate forms for the jurisdiction and carry these documents in the grab bag to protect
from any harm or damage. Monitoring activities related to the consent should be part of a well-
documented procedure in the obtained consent.

A witness is a person who is present while signing a document or agreement and testifies that
the parties mentioned in the agreement have voluntarily signed for it. Depending on the
legislation in the jurisdiction, the agreement or contract needs the signatures of one or two
witnesses.

Typically, one witness signature suffices if the forensic analyst or law enforcement officer is
performing the seizure. When the case requires two witness signatures, seek guidance to
determine the second signatory.

The witness signature verifies that the information in the consent form and other written
documents are correct and have also been explained to and understood by the other party, and
they had given the consent voluntarily.

Whoever signs as witness should have a clear understanding of their role and may have to
provide a witness statement or attend court.

When preparing a case, Computer Forensic Professionals (CFPs) follow a standard system
analysis to solve a problem. They start their investigation by collecting evidence and conducting
preliminary interviews. As a part of their preliminary investigation, they enquire about all those
who were present on the site at the time of the offense. After identifying the persons present
at the time of the crime, they conduct individual interviews and recognize all personnel
(witnesses and others) available at the crime scene and note down their position at the time of
entry and their reason for being there.

As part of their investigation process, CFPs first determine whether the suspect has committed
a crime or has violated any departmental policies. Usually, departments establish certain
policies regarding the usage of computers.

Consistent with departmental policies and applicable laws, the CFP gathers evidence and
collects information from individuals, such as:

= Actual holders or users of any electronic devices present at the crime scene.
=» Usernames and Internet service provider.

= Passwords required to access the system, software, or data.

= Purpose of using the system.

» Automatic applications in use.

= Any offsite data storage.

» Unique security schemes or destructive devices.

= Documents detailing installation of a hardware or software on the system.

» Any offsite data storage.
= Web mail and social networking website account information.

lf the evidence gathered by the CFP suggests that the suspect has committed a crime, he or she
will produce that evidence in court. If the evidence suggests that the suspect has breached
company policy, the CFP will hand over the evidence at the corporate enquiry.

Conducting

(Cont’d)

If the suspect is present at the time of the search and seizure, the incident manager or the
laboratory manager may consider asking some questions. However, they must comply with
the relevant human resources or legislative guidelines with regard to their jurisdiction

During an initial interview, suspects are often taken off guard, having been given little time

to create a false story. This means that they will often answer questions suchas, “What are
the passwords for the account?” truthfully

If the system administrator is present at the time of the initial interview, he or she may help
provide important information such as how many systems are involved, whois associated
with a particular account, and what the relevant passwords are

A person having physical custody of evidence is responsible for the safety and security of
that evidence

Whenever possible, evidence must be secured in such a way that only a person with

Once the forensic team has arrived at the scene and unloaded their equipment, they will move
to the scene of the incident and try to identify any evidence. A perpetrator may use a Sself-
destruct program or reformat the storage media upon the arrival of the team. To account for
such possibilities, pull the power cord connected to the central processing system immediately.

Identify, collect, label, preserve, and protect all digital evidence at the scene.

Isolate the computer system (workstation, standalone, or network server) or other
forms of media so that digital evidence will not be lost.

In many cases, computer systems create backups on a regular basis. Though an attacker
might delete files from the primary storage media, these files could still exist on the
backup storage media.

Include a search and seizure evidence log containing brief descriptions of all computers,
devices, or media located during the search for evidence.

The investigating officer or first responder must perform the investigation process in a lawtul
manner; otherwise, a court of law will reject the collected evidence. The first responder needs a
search warrant for search and seizure of the electronic devices. A search warrant is a written
permission from a concerned authority that mentions the electronic devices that the
investigating officer or the first responder can search and seize. The court of law can also issue
a search warrant. A magistrate may issue the search warrant if the first responder has
convinced the magistrate of evidence of a crime.

Search warrants for electronic devices focus on the following:

An investigator can perform the investigation once investigation planning is over. It is advisable
to perform some legal formalities, such as obtaining a search warrant to perform the
investigation from the court. Successful computer search warrants should include the
particulars of the objects that investigators want to seize, and the search strategy used in the

investigation. These steps help the examiner in focusing and executing the search in a better
way.

Depending upon the situation of the case, the warrant can include:
= Entire company or part of the company’s property
*" Floor
» Room
" Carorany Device

» House

The proposed warrant is a one-page form along with attachments incorporated by reference,
which indicates the person or things the investigators need to seize and the place they will
search. If the investigators mention the cause of search, elements that come under search, and
the information about the place of search properly, then the judge will sign the warrant. Under
the federal rules of criminal procedure, the warrant is valid for ten days from the day of signing.

The court of law has allowed the investigators to perform searches without a warrant, but
under certain circumstances, such as when the delay in obtaining a warrant may lead to the
destruction or manipulation of evidence and hamper the investigation process. The following
pronouncements of different U.S. courts have set the precedents for searches without a
warrant:

“When destruction of evidence is imminent, a warrantless seizure of that evidence is justified if
there is probable cause to believe that the item seized constitutes evidence of criminal
activity.” United States v. David, 756 F. Supp. 1385, 1392 (D. Nev. 1991).

Agents may search a place or object without a warrant or probable cause, if a person with
authority has consented. Schneckloth v. Bustamonte, 412 U.S. 218, 219 (1973).

investigation. Collect all the electronic devices or any other media found at the crime scene.
Seize storage devices like hard drives, memory cards, and removable media as they can have
stored information. Handheld devices like smart phones, mobile phones, PDAs, digital
multimedia devices, and GPS receivers can have valuable evidence information like Internet
browsing history, e-mails, chat logs and friend lists, pictures and image files, financial records,
etc.

The peripheral devices themselves are potential evidence. Information stored in the device
such as scanned or printed documents, incoming and outgoing phone and fax numbers, and
information about device usage can all contain valuable evidence.

To preserve the integrity of the physical evidence, handle all the pieces of evidence collected
carefully. Tag all the objects identified as evidence, and mention all the required details on the
tag, such as the time, date, investigator’s name, and control number.

The physical evidence should include:
» Removable media
=" Cables
* Publications
» All computer equipment including peripherals
=» ltems taken from the trash

Chain of custody is a legal document that demonstrates the progression of evidence as it travels
from the original evidence location to the forensic laboratory. It is a roadmap that shows how
investigators collected, analyzed, and preserved the evidence. The investigators need to
present this document in court. It ensures accurate auditing of the original data evidence,
imaging of the source media, tracking of the logs, and so on. The chain of custody shows the
technology used and the methodology adopted in the forensic phases as well as the persons
involved in it.

The chain of custody administers the collection, handling, storage, testing, and disposition of
evidence. It helps to ensure protection of evidence against tampering or substitution of
evidence. Chain of custody documentation should list all the people involved in the collection
and preservation of evidence and their actions, with a stamp for each activity.

The chain of custody form should identify:
# Sample collector
» Sample description, type, and number
*» Sampling data and location
» Any custodians of the sample

Submission of the digital evidence in court requires a multi-dimensional approach. From this
point of view, the chain of custody assumes important significance. The forensic investigator
needs to document each step taken during the period of collecting the evidence. It is important
that the investigators clarify the source, date of recovery, method of recovery, and nature of the
digital evidence.

Original Evidence Should
NEVER Be Used for Analysis

Copyright © by BG-Gemmell. All Rights Reserved. Reproduction is StrictlyProhibited.

Investigation and analysis processes can have both positive and negative impact over the
evidential data, and sometimes these processes can alter this data in such a way that it is no
longer acceptable in a court of law. Therefore, the investigators should make copies of the
evidence and work on it to avoid damage to the original data in case of accidents or mishaps.
This section will discuss the procedures that the investigators should follow to avoid damage of

evidence files.

Performing the investigation on the original evidence can misdirect the investigation to
different results and could make the original evidence vulnerable. Data duplication is an
important step in securing the original evidence. Investigating the original evidence can cause
damage to the identity of the evidence that would make it no longer useful to the case.

Data duplication includes bit-by-bit copying of the original data using a software or hardware
tool. The duplicated data should be an exact blueprint of the original evidence, and make two
or more copies to perform different investigations. The copies can also help if one copy is
damaged. Send the duplicated data to the forensics lab for investigation and further analysis.

Hash values are equivalent to data fingerprints. No two files contain the same hash values. The
hash algorithms used in forensics are MID5 and SHA. Calculate and match the MD5 hash for the
original evidence and the forensic image. The same hash values show that the image is the
same as the evidence.

Tools for calculating hash value are:

" HashCalc: HashCalc is a calculator that allows computing message digest checksums and
HMACs for files, as well as for text and hex strings.

" MD5 Calculator: The MD5 Calculator is a program that will enable you to calculate the

Expert Witness Bringing Evidence to Court

Copyright © by . All Rights Reserved. Reproduction is Strictly Prohibited.

An expert witness is a person who has a thorough knowledge of a subject and whose
credentials can convince others to believe his or her opinions on that subject in a court of law.
Courts call upon the expert witnesses to authenticate the facts and witnesses during any
complex case. Cases involving accidents and deaths often need the help of an expert witness to
verify the severity of injuries and mode of death. Whenever there is a case of probability in any
criminal case that juries and attorneys cannot understand clearly, they call for the advice of an
expert witness, who can clarify the facts and help the court come to a decision. Expert
witnesses cross-examine witnesses and evidence, as a normal witness may influence or
manipulate the truth under many other factors.

The role of an expert witness is to:

» Investigate acrime

Evaluate the evidence

*" Educate the public and court

= Testify in court

=" Conduct investigations on behalf of the court and report the findings back to the court

= Participate in court-appointed expert witness conferences to study any intriguing
incident

= Educate the jury, court, and the individuals related to the case about his or her findings

An expert witness must keep certain factors in mind while testifying in court. The expert
witness must have complete information about the usual procedures during a trial. He or she
must never question the attorney regarding these matters. The attorney will first introduce the
expert witness to the court. The witness will then offer his or her credentials and
accomplishments to establish credibility with the jury. Presenting digital evidence to the court
requires knowledge of new, specialized, evolving, and sometimes complex technology.

After evidence analysis and retrieval, the investigator should prepare a final report, which
should include what the investigator did and found. Basic reports should be able to answer
questions like who, what, when, where, and how of the evidence. In a good computing
investigation, the steps can be repeatable and the results obtained are the same throughout.
The report should explain the computer and network processes and the inner working system.

The investigator should document all the proceedings related to the investigation properly,
which will help to use the report as proof of findings in a court of law. Since the reader can be a
senior personnel manager, a lawyer, or a judge, explanation for various processes provide the
inner workings of the system, and its various interrelated components.

Each organization has its predefined template for report writing. Follow the template and
understand the organization’s needs and requirements while describing the findings. Attach the
log files generated by the forensic tool with the formal report, as they keep track of all the steps
taken and support the findings of the evidence in court. The narrative part should precede the
log in the report based on the fact finding.
