This module will discuss the topics mentioned in the slide:  

**Importance of Computer Forensics**  
- The rapid increase in cyber crimes has led to the development of various laws and standards  
  that define cyber crimes, digital evidence, search and seizure methodology, evidence recovery,  
  and the investigation process.  
- The investigators must follow a forensics investigation process that complies with local laws  
  and established precedents. Any deviation from the standard process may jeopardize the  
  complete investigation.  
- As digital evidence is fragile in nature, a proper and thorough forensic investigation process  
  that ensures the integrity of evidence is critical to proving a case in a court of law.  
- The investigators must follow a repeatable and well-documented set of steps such that  
  every iteration of analysis provides the same findings, or else the findings of the investigation  
  can be invalidated during the cross-examination in a court of law.  

**Pre-Investigation Phase**  
- This phase involves all the tasks performed prior to the commencement of the actual investigation.  
- It involves setting up a computer forensics lab, building a forensics workstation, investigation toolkit,  
  the investigation team, and getting approval from the relevant authority.  
- This phase also includes steps such as planning the process, defining mission goals, and securing  
  the case perimeter and devices involved.  

**Investigation Phase**  
- Considered the main phase of the computer forensics investigation, it involves acquisition,  
  preservation, and analysis of the evidentiary data to identify the source of crime and the culprit.  
- This phase involves implementing technical knowledge to find evidence, examine, document,  
  and preserve the findings as well as evidence.  
- Trained professionals perform all the tasks involved in this phase in order to ensure the quality  
  and integrity of the findings.  

**Post-Investigation Phase**  
- This phase involves reporting and documentation of all the actions undertaken and the findings  
  during the course of an investigation.  
- Ensure that the target audience can easily understand the report as well as provide adequate  
  and acceptable evidence.  
- Every jurisdiction has set standards for reporting the findings and evidence; the report should  
  comply with all such standards as well as be legally sound and acceptable in a court of law.
