## **Origin of the Term "IoT"**
- The concept of IoT became widely recognized in the **early 2000s**.
- The **ITU (International Telecommunication Union) Internet Report (2005)** was among the first formal documents to discuss the term "Internet of Things."
- ITU predicted that:
  - The **number of internet users would reach billions**.
  - **Humans would become the minority users** of the Internet.
  - Instead of human interactions, **machines and devices** would generate most of the traffic.
- This led to a **complex interconnected system** known as IoT.

## **Key IoT Enablers Identified by ITU (2005)**
1. **RFID (Radio-Frequency Identification)**
   - Used for tracking and identifying objects wirelessly.
2. **Nanotechnology**
   - Miniaturization of devices for better efficiency and embedding into everyday objects.
3. **Sensors**
   - Devices that detect environmental changes and collect data.
4. **Smart Networks**
   - Advanced networks that support **machine-to-machine (M2M) communication**.
