This document provides an in-depth look into **Part II** of the *Introduction to IoT* by Dr. Sudip Misra from IIT Kharagpur. Below is a **detailed explanation** of each section covered in the text.  

---

### **1. IoT Resulting in Address Crunch**
- By 2018, it was estimated that **20-50 billion devices** would be connected to the Internet.
- The increase in devices results from integrating **existing devices, smart devices, and constrained nodes** into a single framework.
- IoT relies on different connectivity technologies like:
  - **Cellular (3G, 4G, 5G)**
  - **Wi-Fi, Ethernet**
  - **Upcoming technologies** like Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), DASH7, Insteon, IEEE 802.15.4, etc.
- The **ITU‚Äôs vision** of IoT is becoming reality as the number of **networked devices has outnumbered humans on Earth**.

### **2. Connectivity Terminologies**
Several key terminologies are used in IoT networks:

1. **IoT LAN** (Local Area Network)
   - Covers a **short-range communication**.
   - May or may not be **connected to the Internet**.
   - Restricted to **buildings or organizational areas**.

2. **IoT WAN** (Wide Area Network)
   - Connects **various network segments**.
   - **Organizationally and geographically wide**.
   - Connected to the **Internet**.

3. **IoT Node**
   - A device connected to **other nodes inside a LAN**.
   - Sometimes, it may be **directly connected to the Internet via WAN**.

4. **IoT Gateway**
   - A **router** connecting an **IoT LAN to a WAN** and the **Internet**.
   - Forwards **packets between LAN and WAN** on the **IP layer**.

5. **IoT Proxy**
   - Performs **application layer functions**.
   - Acts as a **middleman** between IoT nodes and other entities.

---

### **3. IoT Network Configurations**
- IoT networks **can be configured like traditional LANs, WANs, and proxies**.
- Nodes (represented as **green circles**) have:
  - **L**: Local link addresses.
  - **LU**: Locally unique link addresses.
- Nodes within a **gateway‚Äôs domain** have unique addresses that **cannot be used globally**.
- This method **saves IP addresses** by **reusing** them in different domains.
- The **gateway** has a **unique network prefix**, making it **identifiable globally**.

---

### **4. Gateway Prefix Allotment**
- A method to **conserve IP addresses** by **assigning local addresses within a gateway domain**.
- The **Internet-connected network** has:
  - **Routers** with their **own addresses and address ranges**.
  - **Gateways** connected to these routers.
- **Routers assign network prefixes** to gateways, helping **identify** them uniquely.

---

### **5. Impact of Mobility on Addressing**
- When a device **moves** from one network to another, **network prefixes change**.
- The **IoT LAN remains unaffected**, but the **IoT gateway WAN address changes**.
- This issue is solved using **Unique Local Addresses (ULA)**.
- **Gateways use Mobile IPv6 and tunneling protocols** (e.g., **IKEv2**) to maintain connectivity when moving between networks.

---

### **6. IoT Gateways**
- **IoT gateways** play a key role in:
  - **Providing Internet connectivity**.
  - **Enabling intra-connectivity within an IoT LAN**.
- Gateways use:
  - **DHCPv6** to obtain upstream address prefixes.
  - **Stateless Address Auto-Configuration (SLAAC)** for assigning local addresses.
- **Application Layer Proxies** allow IoT nodes to:
  - **Communicate globally** even if they only have **local addresses**.
  - Perform **data processing** instead of just forwarding packets.

---

### **7. Multi-Homing**
- **Multi-homing** means that a node or network is **connected to multiple networks** for **reliability**.
- Two approaches for **multi-homing** in IoT:
  1. **Proxy-based approach**:
     - Used in **small IoT LANs**.
     - Manages multiple IP addresses and maps them to **link-local addresses**.
  2. **Gateway-based approach**:
     - Assigns **link-local addresses** to the nodes under it.

- **Challenges in multi-homing**:
  - Assigning **source and destination addresses**.
  - Routing information to **multi-homed nodes**.
  - Standardization is still in progress at the **Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF)**.

### **8. IPv4 vs. IPv6**
| Feature | IPv4 | IPv6 |
|---------|------|------|
| **Developed by** | IETF (1974) | IETF (1998) |
| **Address Length** | 32-bit | 128-bit |
| **Total Addresses** | 2¬≥¬≤ (~4.3 billion) | 2¬π¬≤‚Å∏ (~340 undecillion) |
| **Notation** | Dotted Decimal | Hexadecimal |
| **Address Allocation** | DHCP | SLAAC / DHCPv6 |
| **IP Security (IPSec)** | Optional | Compulsory |

- **IPv4 focuses on reliability**, whereas **IPv6 focuses more on addressing**.
- IPv6 eliminates certain IPv4 features:
  - **No Header Checksum** (IPv6 relies on transport layers for integrity).
  - **No Broadcast Addressing** (IPv6 uses multicast instead).

---

### **9. IPv4 Header vs. IPv6 Header**
- **IPv4 Header Structure**:
  - Contains **fields for reliability** such as:
    - **Type of Service**
    - **Total Length**
    - **Identification**
    - **TTL (Time to Live)**
    - **Checksum**
  
- **IPv6 Header Structure**:
  - **Simplified compared to IPv4**.
  - Focuses **more on source and destination addresses**.
  - **Traffic Class and Flow Label** help **prioritize traffic**.

---

## **Summary**
1. **IoT‚Äôs rapid growth** is causing an **address crunch** due to billions of connected devices.
2. **IoT networks** are structured into **LANs, WANs, Nodes, Gateways, and Proxies**.
3. **Gateways manage address allocation** using network prefixes.
4. **Mobility solutions** like **Mobile IPv6 and tunneling** help IoT devices maintain **connectivity**.
5. **Multi-homing** ensures **network reliability**, but **addressing remains a challenge**.
6. **IPv6 is the future of IoT** due to its **larger address space and efficiency** compared to **IPv4**.
