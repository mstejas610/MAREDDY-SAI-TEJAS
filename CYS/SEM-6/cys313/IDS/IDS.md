### **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)**  

An **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** is a **security technology** used to monitor and analyze **network traffic** or **system activity** to detect **unauthorized access, cyber-attacks, or policy violations**. It helps organizations **identify security breaches** and respond quickly to prevent further damage.  

#### **Main Functions of an IDS**  
1. **Packet Sniffing & Network Analysis**  
   - IDS **captures data packets** traveling over the network.  
   - These packets contain **source & destination IP addresses, protocols, and data payloads**.  
   - IDS inspects these packets **in real-time** to identify security threats.  

2. **Protocol Inspection**  
   - IDS analyzes the **TCP/IP protocol stack** (OSI Model Layer 3: Network & Layer 4: Transport).  
   - It looks for **malicious patterns**, such as **abnormal traffic behavior or unauthorized access attempts**.  

3. **Threat Detection & Alerts**  
   - IDS **identifies malicious packets** based on **predefined rules, attack signatures, or anomaly detection**.  
   - When a **threat is detected**, IDS **generates an alert**, notifying security administrators.

### **How IDS Detects an Intrusion**  

IDS uses **different detection techniques** to identify **malicious activity** in a network:  

#### **1. Signature-Based Detection**  
- IDS **compares incoming network traffic** with a database of **known attack signatures**.  
- If a **pattern matches**, an alert is generated.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - May produce **false positives** if harmless traffic matches an attack signature.  
  - Requires **continuous signature updates** to detect new threats.  

#### **2. Anomaly-Based Detection**  
- IDS detects **deviations from normal behavior**.  
- If network activity exceeds a **tolerance threshold**, it is classified as an **attack**.  
- **Limitations:**  
  - May generate **false positives** for unusual but legitimate traffic.  
  - Requires **training** to define "normal" behavior.  

#### **3. Protocol Anomaly Detection**  
- IDS detects **protocol-specific anomalies** by identifying **misconfigurations or vulnerabilities**.  
- Example: **Flawed TCP/IP implementations** can be exploited by attackers.

### **Types of Intrusions Detected by IDS**  

#### **1. File System Intrusions**  
Attackers may gain **unauthorized access** to files or directories, affecting **data integrity, confidentiality, and availability**.  

- **Unexpected File Modifications:**  
  - Unauthorized changes to **system files, security files, or application settings**.  
  - Bulk modifications or changes **outside normal business hours** are red flags.  

- **Suspicious File Creations:**  
  - IDS detects **unexpected new files** (e.g., `.exe, .bat, .sh`), which may indicate **malware execution**.  
  - Hidden files created with **"hidden" or "system" attributes**.  

- **Unusual File Access Patterns:**  
  - Access to **sensitive files** (password databases, financial records) by **unauthorized users**.  

- **File Permission Changes:**  
  - IDS detects **unauthorized access right modifications**, such as changing files from **restricted to read/write**.  

- **File Integrity Monitoring:**  
  - IDS checks **file hashes or checksums** to detect tampering.  

#### **2. Network Intrusions**  
Malicious activities targeting the **network infrastructure**.  

- **Unusual Network Traffic:**  
  - **High spikes** or **drops** in network activity.  
  - Communication with **unknown or suspicious IP addresses**.  

- **Port Scanning & Probing:**  
  - Attackers scan ports to find **open vulnerabilities**.  
  - IDS detects **excessive connection attempts** (SYN packets).  

- **Protocol Anomalies:**  
  - IDS flags **malformed HTTP requests or unusual DNS queries**.  

- **Flooding Attacks (DDoS):**  
  - Attackers **overwhelm network resources** by flooding with traffic.  
  - IDS detects **ICMP (ping) flood or SYN flood attacks**.  

- **Suspicious Connections:**  
  - IDS monitors **foreign connections or VPN usage** by attackers trying to bypass detection.  

#### **3. System Intrusions**  
Attackers may attempt to **gain system control** or **elevate privileges**.  

- **Unexpected User Accounts & Privileges:**  
  - Creation of **new admin accounts** without authorization.  
  - Unauthorized **access to PowerShell or sudo commands**.  

- **Rootkits & Malware Detection:**  
  - IDS identifies **hidden processes, backdoors, or malware infections**.  

- **System Resource Exhaustion:**  
  - Attackers **consume CPU, memory, or disk space** (e.g., cryptojacking).  

- **Log Tampering & Deletion:**  
  - IDS detects attempts to **erase system logs** to hide traces of attacks.

### **Types of IDS**  

#### **1. Network-Based IDS (NIDS)**  
- Monitors network traffic using **sensors at critical points** (e.g., firewall, routers, servers).  
- Captures and **analyzes packets**, comparing them with **attack signatures**.  

#### **2. Host-Based IDS (HIDS)**  
- Installed on **individual hosts (PCs, servers)** to monitor **local activities** (file access, logins, processes).  
- Detects **unauthorized file modifications** and **suspicious user behavior**.

### **Intrusion Detection System (IDS) Using YARA Rules**  

**YARA (Yet Another Recursive Acronym)** is a **malware detection tool** used to **match patterns in files, memory, or processes**.  

#### **How IDS Works with YARA Rules**  
1. **Network Monitoring:** IDS **monitors traffic** and extracts **suspicious files**.  
2. **File Analysis:** YARA **checks files against malware signatures**.  
3. **Administrative Response:** Detected threats are **quarantined** for investigation.  

**Example YARA Rule:**  
```yara
rule MaliciousPDF {
    meta:
        author = "Security Analyst"
        description = "Detects a PDF with suspicious keywords"
    strings:
        $a = "stream"
        $b = "obj"
        $c = /[^\x00-\x7F]/ // Detects non-ASCII characters
    condition:
        $a and $b and #c > 10
}
```

### **SNORT (Open-Source IDS/IPS)**  

**Snort** is a lightweight **intrusion detection and prevention tool**.  

#### **Snort Modes:**  
1. **Sniffer Mode:** Captures live packets.  
2. **Packet Logger Mode:** Saves traffic for later analysis.  
3. **NIDS Mode:** Detects attacks based on Snort rules.  

**Example Snort Rule:**  
```snort
alert tcp any any -> 192.168.1.100 80 (msg:"Potential Web Attack"; content:"GET"; nocase; sid:1001; rev:1;)
```
- Detects **HTTP GET requests** to **192.168.1.100 on port 80**.  
- Generates an **alert** when matched.

### **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)**  

An **Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)** is an **advanced security tool** that **not only detects threats (like IDS) but also takes immediate action to block them**.  

#### **Types of IPS:**  
1. **Network-based IPS (NIPS):** Monitors **network traffic** for attacks.  
2. **Host-based IPS (HIPS):** Detects threats on **specific devices**.  
3. **Wireless IPS (WIPS):** Protects **Wi-Fi networks**.  
4. **Network Behavior Analysis (NBA) IPS:** Identifies **abnormal traffic patterns**.  

#### **How IPS Works:**  
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Inspects network layers 2-7.  
- **Detection Methods:** Uses **signature-based & anomaly-based detection**.  
- **Prevention Actions:**  
  - **Blocks traffic**  
  - **Terminates connections**  
  - **Rate limits DDoS attacks**  
  - **Quarantines infected devices**
