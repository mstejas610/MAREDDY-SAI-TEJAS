# C++ Concepts Revision Plan  

### **Goal**: Strengthen C++ fundamentals while solving problems during the "Week of Code" challenge.

---

## **Daily Revision Plan**
- **Focus**: Review one core C++ concept each day for 30 minutes to 1 hour.
- **Timing**: Revise after solving coding problems or before starting the day's challenge.

### **Day 1** - **December 18th, 2024**
- **Concept**: Basic Syntax & Input/Output
  - **What to Revise**: Data types, variables, loops, conditional statements, and simple input/output techniques.
  - **Practice**: Write simple C++ programs for basic operations (e.g., sum of numbers, check even/odd).
  
### **Day 2** - **December 19th, 2024**
- **Concept**: Functions & Recursion
  - **What to Revise**: Function declaration, definition, recursion basics, base case, and recursive solutions.
  - **Practice**: Implement recursive problems like factorial or Fibonacci sequence.
  
### **Day 3** - **December 20th, 2024**
- **Concept**: Arrays & Strings
  - **What to Revise**: Array initialization, traversing arrays, string manipulation techniques.
  - **Practice**: Solve problems involving arrays and string manipulation.

### **Day 4** - **December 21st, 2024**
- **Concept**: Pointers & Dynamic Memory
  - **What to Revise**: Pointers, memory management, dynamic arrays, and pointer arithmetic.
  - **Practice**: Implement dynamic memory allocation and pointer-based operations.

### **Day 5** - **December 22nd, 2024**
- **Concept**: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
  - **What to Revise**: Classes, objects, constructors, destructors, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation.
  - **Practice**: Write small programs implementing classes, inheritance, and polymorphism.

### **Day 6** - **December 23rd, 2024**
- **Concept**: STL (Standard Template Library)
  - **What to Revise**: Common STL containers (vector, map, set), iterators, algorithms.
  - **Practice**: Use STL containers in problems to simplify code.

### **Day 7** - **December 24th, 2024**
- **Concept**: Advanced C++ Features
  - **What to Revise**: Exception handling, templates, lambda functions, and file I/O.
  - **Practice**: Write code implementing these advanced concepts in a small project.
