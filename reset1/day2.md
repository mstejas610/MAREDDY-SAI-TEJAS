## **Plan for Day 2**  
1. **Catch up on missed tasks**:  
   - Start with the first day's plan:  
     - Solve 3 easy problems from the "Week of Code" challenge.  
     - Review basic syntax and simple problem-solving skills in C++.  

2. **Time Allocation**:  
   - Spend 1â€“2 hours solving problems.  
   - Dedicate 30â€“45 minutes revising C++ basics.  

3. **Stay Consistent**:  
   - Log completed tasks and reflect on what youâ€™ve learned today.
